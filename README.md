# RPI-app

Simple app where I was playing with raspberry pi and windows Iot core. I tried to use several new technologies I have not used before and create simple application where rpi sends temperature data in specified time interval to api which stores data to database. Both api and database are hosted on Azure. I have created web app which shows stored data in graph and can control rpi with 'direct method' call technology (it can turn on and off fan). The app is not complete yet. 

Technologies:
C#
UWP
Windows Iot Core v 17763
Azure API
Azure SQL database
Entity framework
ASP.NET
Azure Iot Hub
